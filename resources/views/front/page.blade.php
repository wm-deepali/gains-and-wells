                                        <p>Basically, tax residency is the country of your citizenship. If you have two

                                            can be taxed by both countries. This is called double tax and there is a
                                            solution that is known as DTAA (Double Tax Avoidance Agreement). DTAA is the
                                            agreement between two countries to issue a tax residence certificate and the
                                            certificate holder is able to claim treaty benefits.</p>
